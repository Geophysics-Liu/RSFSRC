\end{verbatim}

\section{Digital signal analysis}

You can either write your answers to theoretical questions on paper or
edit them in the file \texttt{hw3/paper.tex}. Please show all the
mathematical derivations that you perform.

\begin{enumerate}

\item The matrix in equation~(\ref{eq:conv}) represents a convolution operator with zero boundary conditions.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:conv}
\mathbf{F} = \left[\begin{array}{llllll}
f_1 & f_0 & 0   & 0   & 0   & 0   \\
f_2 & f_1 & f_0 & 0   & 0   & 0   \\
f_3 & f_2 & f_1 & f_0 & 0   & 0   \\
0   & f_3 & f_2 & f_1 & f_0 & 0   \\
0   & 0   & f_3 & f_2 & f_1 & f_0 \\
0   & 0   & 0   & f_3 & f_2 & f_1 \\
\end{array}\right]\;.
\end{equation}

The operator is implemented in the C function \texttt{hw3/conv.c}.

\lstset{language=c,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,showstringspaces=false}
\lstinputlisting[frame=single,firstline=15,title=hw3/conv.c]{conv.c}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Modify the matrix and the program to implement periodic boundary conditions.
\item Add the code for the adjoint (matrix transpose) operator.
\end{enumerate}

\item The C code in \texttt{hw3/filter.c} implements a recursive filtering
  operator.

\lstset{language=c,numbers=left,numberstyle=\tiny,showstringspaces=false}
\lstinputlisting[frame=single,firstline=13,title=hw3/filter.c]{filter.c}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Express this filter in the $Z$-transform notation as a ratio
  of two polynomials.
\item Add code for the adjoint operator.
\end{enumerate}

\item Show that, using the helix transform and imposing helical boundary conditions, it is possible to compute a 2-D digital Fourier transform using 1-D FFT program. Assuming the input data is of size $N \times N$, would this approach have any computational advantages?

\end{enumerate}

\section{Fourier compression}
\inputdir{fourier}

In this exercise, we will use a depth slice selected from a 3-D
seismic volume and shown in Figure~\ref{fig:data}\footnote{Courtesy of
Matt Hall (ConocoPhillips Canada Ltd.)}. Notice a channel structure.

\sideplot{data}{width=\textwidth}{Seismic depth slice with a channel structure.}

\sideplot{fft}{width=\textwidth}{Absolute value of the Fourier transform of 
the seismic slice from Figure~\ref{fig:data}. The circle inside shows
a window selected for compression.}

The goal of your assignment is to find a compressed representation of
the data in the Fourier transform domain. Figure~\ref{fig:fft} shows
the Fourier transform of the data from Figure~\ref{fig:data}. We can
see that most of the energy gets concentrated near the center (zero
frequency).

There are two alternative ways to compress data in the Fourier domain:
\begin{itemize}
\item One approach is to
select a range of frequencies that contain the most important
information. An advantage of this approach is the ability to subsample
the original data by transforming back from a windowed range of frequencies.
The results from this method are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sig,cut}.
\item Another approach is to zero all Fourier coefficients below a certain threshold value, regardless of which frequencies they represent.  
 The results from this method are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:thr,noi}. 
Figure~\ref{fig:hist} shows a selected threshold plotted against the histogram of Fourier coefficients.
\end{itemize}

\multiplot{2}{sig,cut}{width=0.45\textwidth}{Data separated into signal (a) and noise (b) by applying Fourier compression with windowing.}
\multiplot{2}{thr,noi}{width=0.45\textwidth}{Data separated into signal (a) and noise (b) by applying Fourier compression with thresholding.}

\sideplot{hist}{width=0.8\textwidth}{Normalized histogram of Fourier coefficients (by absolute value). The vertical line shows a selected threshold.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Change directory to \texttt{hw3/fourier}.
\item Run 
\begin{verbatim}
scons view
\end{verbatim}
to reproduce the figures on your screen.
\item Modify the \texttt{SConstruct} file to decrease the size of the window so that the noise level increases in Figure~\ref{fig:cut}. How do you measure the noise level? Find a level that you find negligibly small.
\item Modify the \texttt{SConstruct} file to increase the threshold value so that the compression achieves the same quality as in the previous case. The noise level in Figure~\ref{fig:noi} should match that in Figure~\ref{fig:cut}.
\item Compare the number of nonzero Fourier coefficients in both cases. Which method achieves a better compression?
\item \textbf{EXTRA CREDIT} for finding a way for a better compression of the data in the Fourier domain. Your data reconstruction should have 
the same noise level, yet the number of non-zero coefficients in the Fourier domain should be smaller.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Projection onto convex sets}
\inputdir{pocs}

\sideplot{hole}{width=\textwidth}{Seismic depth slice
  after removing selected parts of the data.}

The goal of the next exercise is to figure out if one can use compactness
of the Fourier transform to reconstruct missing data. The missing
parts are created artificially by cutting holes in the original data
(Figure~\ref{fig:hole}).

\multiplot{2}{fft-data,fft-hole}{width=0.4\textwidth}{Fourier transform of the original data (a) and data with holes
  with holes (b). The absolute value is displayed}

\sideplot{fft-mask}{width=0.8\textwidth}{Fourier-domain mask for selecting a convex set.}

Figures~\ref{fig:fft-data} and~\ref{fig:fft-hole} show the digital
Fourier transform of the original data and the data with holes. We
observe again that the support of the data in the Fourier domain is
compact thanks to the data smoothness. Cutting holes in the physical
domain creates discontinuities that make the Fourier response spread
beyond the original support. Figure~\ref{fig:fft-mask} shows a
Fourier-domain mask designed to contain the support of the original
data.

To accomplish the task of missing data interpolation, we will use an
iterative method known as POCS (\emph{projection onto convex
sets}). By definition, a convex set $\mathcal{C}$ is a set of
functions such that, for any $f_1(\mathbf{x})$ and $f_2(\mathbf{x})$
from the set, $g(\mathbf{x}) = \lambda\,f_1(\mathbf{x}) +
(1-\lambda)\,f_2(\mathbf{x})$ (for $0 \le \lambda \le 1$) also belongs
to the set. A projection onto a convex set means finding a function in
the set that is of the shortest distance to the given function. The
POCS theorem states that if one wants to find a function that belongs
to the intersection of two convex sets $C_1$ and $C_2$, the task can
be accomplished iteratively by alternating projections onto the two
sets.

In our example, $C_1$ is the set of all functions that are equal to
the known data outside of the holes. $C_2$ is the set of all functions
that have a predifined compact support in the Fourier domain (and
therefore are smooth in the physical domain). The algorithm consists
of the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Apply 2-D Fourier transform. 
\item Multiply by a Fourier-transform mask to enforce compact support.
\item Apply inverse 2-D Fourier transform.
\item Replace data outside of the holes with known data.
\item Repeat.
\end{enumerate}
The output after 5 iterations is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pocs}.

  iterative projection onto convex sets.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item How many iterations are required for convergence?

\item \textbf{EXTRA CREDIT} for finding a different convex set for either faster or more accurate missing data reconstruction.
